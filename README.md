# stress-level-detection
The "Stress Level Detection" project, utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to accurately identify common sleeping positions such as free fall, log, foetus, and starfish. 
By integrating with OpenCV for live videocapture, the model dynamically calculates an individual's stress level during sleep cycles using the identified common sleeping positions.
