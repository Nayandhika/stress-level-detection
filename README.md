# stress-level-detection
The "Stress Level Detection" project employs advanced deep learning methods to recognize sleeping positions such as free fall, log, starfish and foetus positions. 
Utilizing OpenCV for live video capture, the system dynamically assesses stress levels based on these identified sleep positions throughout the sleep cycle.

The code was designed for real-time monitoring, capturing data at 7 intervals per minute to simulate an adult's 7-hour sleep cycle.
